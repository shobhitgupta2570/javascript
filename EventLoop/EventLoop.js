// The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript, particularly important for understanding how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations.
// It enables non-blocking I/O operations, allowing JavaScript to perform other tasks while waiting for external
//  operations (such as I/O, timers, or network requests) to complete.
