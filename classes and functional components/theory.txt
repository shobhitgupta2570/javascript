In React, we can create components using either class components or functional components.

Class Components:

Syntax: They are ES6 classes that extend from React.Component.
State Management: Managed using this.state and updated with this.setState().
Lifecycle Methods: Have built-in lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
this Keyword: Used to access props, state, and methods.


Functional Components:

Syntax: Simpler, defined as plain JavaScript functions.
State Management: Managed using React hooks like useState and useReducer.
Lifecycle Methods: Use hooks like useEffect to handle side effects, mimicking lifecycle methods.
No this Keyword: They donâ€™t use the this keyword.
React Hooks:
With the introduction of hooks in React 16.8, functional components gained the ability to manage state and side effects. Key hooks include:

useState for state management.
useEffect for handling side effects, similar to lifecycle methods in class components.
